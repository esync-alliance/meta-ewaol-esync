**Invehicle Certificate provisioning for xl4bus participant nodes **

-----------------------------------------------------
** Create User Certificates for new agents:
-----------------------------------------------------
To create new user certificates follow the steps below,

   * Path of InVehicle certificate directory :  '<sdk_package_name>/xl4/InVehicle-Certs'

   Adding new node certs:
   ----------------------
   1) 1) Create the new file with .cfg extentaion for generating certificates with different types of nodes in the config folder.
  	E.g.,ua-three.cfg
	#This configuration file is read while creating x509 certificates.	
 	
        CERT_TYPE="_UA"
	LABEL_NAME="ua"
	UA_ADDR0="/NODE1"
	UA_ADDR1="/NODE2"
        UA_ADDR2="/NODE3"  
   2) In the LABEL_NAME provide ua label name. 
   3) In CERT_TYPE "_UA" should be present.	    
   4) Save the file after adding all the UA and their associated node type.
   5) For more information related to how to create .cfg file in config folder please refer ua_three.tmpl file which is present inside config folder. 
   6) Run the following commands:
      Usage options :
      $ ./installer.sh    
               -i  # Install's SDK on this linux hardware
               -u  # Uninstall's on this linux hardware
               -h  # Help / Usage Options
      E.g., 
	$ ./installer.sh -i
   
   7) The certs for new UA will be created in the pki/certs directory. New .cfg will be added to the config directory for future use.
   8) Run the new user updateagents, using certificates:
      $ <new user updateagent binary path> -k <new user updateagent certificate path> -d  
      E.g., 
	    $ '{$HOME}/xl4/bin/ua-three -k {$HOME}/xl4/InVehicle-Certs/pki/certs/ua-three -d'
 
   Note : .cfg extention must be provide with your config file.
